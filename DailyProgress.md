# Day 1 Progress Report (Emre):
- We came up with the structure of a powerpoint presentation.
- Our plan is to continue working on this project tomorrow and finalize a rough draft.
- We want to be able to make the presentation easy to digest and market, so that it logically flows through the user's mind.
- Another goal we came up with during the meeting is to have a document containing our business plan. This will help us stay on track and keep several
  questions constantly in our minds about how to operate this application.

# Day 2 Progress Report (Emre):
- Initialized the powerpoint and business model.
- The business model is 18% done
